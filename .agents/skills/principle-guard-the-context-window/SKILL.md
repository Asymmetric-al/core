# Guard the Context Window

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**

- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to `delegate_task` workers. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.

## This repository (Asymmetric-al/core)

Vendored from [p3-stack](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/p3-stack) (MIT) at commit `09909eb`. Provenance is in `references/upstream.md`. On conflict, the current user request, root `AGENTS.md`, the nearest nested `AGENTS.md`, and the matching `docs/ai/rules/*` rulebook win over this skill.

- Explicit invocation only: use it when the user invokes `/principle-guard-the-context-window` (Claude Code, Cursor, T3 Code) or `$principle-guard-the-context-window` (Codex), or when an invoked p3-stack skill routes here. Do not route other work to it.
- The T3 Code tools named above map to Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor in `docs/ai/skills/p3-mode/references/core-adapter.md`. Read it before you delegate, watch a PR, schedule work, or drive a preview outside T3 Code.
- Confirm before outward-facing or hard-to-reverse actions such as pushing, merging, deploying, deleting, or posting messages, unless the user authorized that action for this task.

Edit this canonical copy in `docs/ai/skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/`, then run `bun run skills:sync` and `bun run skills:verify`.
