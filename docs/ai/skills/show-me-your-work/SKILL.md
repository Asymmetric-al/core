# Show me your work

Keep one canonical log.

## The format

A single TSV file, one row per decision. Cells stay single-line. Evidence is a pointer, not prose.

Copy `references/decision-log-template.tsv` (the header row) to start a clean log. Columns:

- **ts.** ISO8601 timestamp.
- **phase.** The phase or workstream.
- **decision.** What was chosen or done, one line.
- **why.** The reason in plain words. If a principle drove it, say it plainly, not as a jargon tag.
- **evidence.** A link or path that proves it: commit SHA, PR number, `file:line`, or an artifact, trace, or screenshot path. Never a paragraph.
- **result.** The outcome or predicate state: `tests green`, `reverted`, `pixel-diff 0`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `open`.

An example, plain-spoken so a reviewer reads it at a glance.

```
ts	phase	decision	why	evidence	result
2026-05-24T09:02:00Z	frame	counted the work first, about 100 components and roughly 75 hours	wanted to know the size before starting a long run	commit 3a9f1c2	found 5 things to sort out before starting
2026-05-24T09:40:00Z	harness	took screenshots of the old version before changing anything	so we can compare old against new and catch any visual change	scripts/snapshot.sh, baseline/	saved 120 reference screenshots
2026-05-24T11:15:00Z	widget	moved the widget styles over without changing how it looks	keep the change small and the result identical	commit 7c21e0a, pixel-diff 0	looks identical, tests pass
2026-05-24T12:30:00Z	widget	threw out a helper's work because its screenshots were blank	checked the real files instead of trusting its summary	worktree reset	reverted, tightened the instructions for next time
```

## Logging a row

Write each entry the way you'd tell a teammate what you did. Plain words, concrete actions, no AI speak or abstract jargon (the **unslop** skill applies to log text too).

Use the helper `scripts/log.sh <logfile> <phase> <decision> <why> <evidence> <result>`. It stamps `ts`, writes the header on first use, strips stray tabs/newlines, and prefixes any cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` with a single quote. A bare `printf` appending a row works too, but mind those same bytes if cells come from generated or user-supplied text.

Log decision points and checkpoints, not every action: a fork chosen, a unit completed with its verification result, a pivot or revert with its trigger, a blocker surfaced, a gate fixed. For loop runs, one row per iteration. Skip the trivial and self-evident.

A run is one agent conversation, including its later turns and any summary of it. A pickup, a replacement agent, or a new thread starts a new run. When a run adds to a log that already has rows, its first row has phase `start`, and so does its first row after another run's `start` row. So a run that comes back to a log in a later turn first reads the log's last rows to see whether another run wrote since. A `start` row names the `ts` range of the rows before it that this run did not write, and its evidence names this run, such as its thread id or task id. Use phase `start` for nothing else.

## Where it lives

By default the log is a working artifact, not committed. Keep it at `decisions.tsv` in the work dir, or `.audit/<task-slug>.tsv` when several efforts run at once, and leave it out of git.

Commit it only when the work is ambitious enough that a reviewer needs the trail to trust the result.

## Rules

- Append-only. A wrong call gets a new row that supersedes it. Never edit or delete history.
- Prefer evidence produced by committed scripts over hand-made one-offs (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).

## Audit the log against the transcript

At the end of the run, before handing back, check the log told the truth. The transcript is this T3 thread: read it with `t3_thread_read`, and use `t3_thread_search` to pull exact passages. Read only this run's thread; searching other threads reads unrelated private chats. Walk this run's rows against the thread's timeline. Each stretch of them begins at one of this run's `start` rows, or at the first row if this run created the log, and ends at the next `start` row of another run:

- Check that every row maps to a real decision or action.
- Check that each row's evidence resolves and shows what the row claims.
- A fork, pivot, or abandoned approach that shaped the work but isn't logged is a gap. Add it.

Correct the log, not the story. The audit never edits or removes a row, even an invented one. When a row records neither a real decision nor a real action, or its claim or evidence is wrong, add a row that supersedes it with what actually happened and a pointer that resolves. This audit does not check rows outside this run's stretches. If this run's own work shows one of them is wrong, supersede it like any wrong call.

## Cross-model review of the trail

Before handing back, spawn a reviewer with `delegate_task` (`mode: "async"`, drained with `task_status`) on a different provider or model family from the one that did the work, resolved through `orchestrator_capabilities`; never hardcode a slug. Self-review is not a substitute. Its brief stands alone (T3 child agents get only the brief, never this conversation) and says read-only: inspect only, no writes.

The reviewer reads the audit trail and the run's transcript with `t3_thread_read`, then flags what the user should pay attention to. Not a redo of the work, a scan for what's suboptimal or risky.

- Decisions logged with weak or absent evidence.
- Verification steps skipped or claimed without proof in the transcript.
- Choices that look risky in hindsight (premature, scope-creeping, papering over a symptom).
- Gaps the user would otherwise miss on a casual skim.

Every reply for a run that produced a trail ends with an "Attention" section. Lead with the reviewer's model on its own line (`reviewed by <model>`), then list each flag pointing to specific rows or moments. "No flags" is a valid value. The model name is not.

## Reviewing the trail

Read top to bottom, follow the evidence pointers, spot-check. GitHub renders a committed TSV as a table. `column -s$'\t' -t decisions.tsv` renders it in a terminal.

## Composing this skill

Other skills route their audit trail here instead of inventing one. Reference it by name and let it own the format. Don't restate the columns.

## This repository (Asymmetric-al/core)

Vendored from [p3-stack](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/p3-stack) (MIT) at commit `09909eb`. Provenance is in `references/upstream.md`. On conflict, the current user request, root `AGENTS.md`, the nearest nested `AGENTS.md`, and the matching `docs/ai/rules/*` rulebook win over this skill.

- Explicit invocation only: use it when the user invokes `/show-me-your-work` (Claude Code, Cursor, T3 Code) or `$show-me-your-work` (Codex), or when an invoked p3-stack skill routes here. Do not route other work to it.
- The T3 Code tools named above map to Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor in `docs/ai/skills/p3-mode/references/core-adapter.md`. Read it before you delegate, watch a PR, schedule work, or drive a preview outside T3 Code.
- Confirm before outward-facing or hard-to-reverse actions such as pushing, merging, deploying, deleting, or posting messages, unless the user authorized that action for this task.
- The decision log stays local and uncommitted unless the user asks to commit it. `scripts/log.sh` needs bash (Git Bash or WSL on Windows).

Edit this canonical copy in `docs/ai/skills/show-me-your-work/`, then run `bun run skills:sync` and `bun run skills:verify`.
